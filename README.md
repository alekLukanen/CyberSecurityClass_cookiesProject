This website demonstrates how to use javascript to save
cookies and how to use vue.js to interact with the DOM.

### Boot the Website
To create your python environment simply run
```
make build_env
```
from the repositories base directory and then run
```
source env/bin/activate
```
to activate the virtual environment. Now we can
boot the server with
```
python website/manage.py runserver
```
You should have a server running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
Now that the server is running you can navigate to the
homepage at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/index.html`.
