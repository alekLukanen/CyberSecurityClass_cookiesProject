This website demonstrates how to use javascript to save
cookies and how to use vue.js to interact with the DOM.

### Boot the Website
To create your python environment simply run
```
make build_env
```
and then run
```
source env/bin/activate
```
to activate your new virtual environment. Now we can
boot the server with
```
python website/manage.py runserver
```
You should have a server running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
